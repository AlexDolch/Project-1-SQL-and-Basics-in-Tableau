## First project of the Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School

###   SQL and Data Visualization with Tableau

---

 This is my first project for my Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School.  
 We, as a group, had to explore some data from a company called "Magist" and  
 evaluate a possible Takeover by another company called "Eniac".  
 Our group decided for a pretty straightforward approach against a Takeover,  
 since the data clearly indicated that early on.  
 We learned to use:
 - **SQL**
 - **Tableau**
